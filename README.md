### Prerequisites

I created the site that is in use for the Fulton Fithouse now which you can be viewed here [Fulton Fithouse live site](https://rashadmad.github.io/)
This was the project where I started to make the leap into Frontend development. I Really enjoyed

```
With the new mockup that I created I implemented some functionality using JavaScript. This project was the first I used JavaScript. Basically I
leveraged JavaScript to make the data on the site easier to manage.

## Cool stuff about the website

#### One page site & smoothScroll
```
I love that the site is "one page" unfortunately the client prefers multiple pages. I argued the point that a one page site was great for user experience
also it has a way of making sure a user fully absorbs the info that you want to get across. Also the smooth scroll effect was a nice touch. Latter on I have learned that
having a multiple page site is much better for SEO. Also it is easier to track a users interest in a site with multiple pages.
```

### Installing

This site consist of some jQuery functionality and uses google fonts but nothing needs to pre installed for you to make changes to it. fork it to
your repo then download it.

## What I learned

This project was one of the first web projects that I was excited about upon completion. I took a mobile first approach which saved me a headache during the project.
I created because I learned a great deal creating the original site and I knew I could make something better.
