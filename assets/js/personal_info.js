// Problem: I have a modal that needs diffrent info for all of the personal in the gym
// 1.1 I need to capture which person is connected to which button
// 1.2 I need to then grab that persones name + there bio + then there title (all diffrent elements and tags)
// 1.3 then those elements need to be put into the modal CORRECTLY i.e. (the title of the modal needs to say the name of the personal)
